            due dates, thereby to regularize your account. It is noted that you
            did not intend to co-operate with my client but refrained from

            My client states that you have willfully defaulted in making payments
            towards the above-mentioned Loan Account and an intention to delay the
            legitimate payments due to the bank is evident from your conduct. You
            are also fully aware of the fact that my client has been put to loss
            as you did not make the payment of monthly installments intentionally.
            You have thereby caused a wrongful loss to my client and your act
            amounts to criminal breach of trust.

        <div class="flex gap-5">
          <span>6. </span>
          <span>
            That my client came to know that you now shifted to abroad and
            intentionally not making the payment of outstanding amount, which is
            the clear violation of Loan Agreement.
          </span>
        </div>
        <div class="flex gap-5">
          <span>7. </span>
          <span>
            That now it is apparent that you have an intention from the very
            beginning to cheat my client, because in pursuance to said guilty
            intention, you have applied for
            <span class="bold">${
              data?.product
            }</span> and also assured that you will
            make the timely payments, whereas on the basis of your assurances and
            promises, my client got convinced and induced to disburse
            <span class="bold">${
              data?.product
            }</span> and now you have committed default
            in making the due payments of the loan, thus my client suffered the
            losses due to your dishonest intentions and by the act to breach the
            trust, however if my client was aware about your dishonest intentions
            earlier, definitely they would not have disbursed
            <span class="bold">${
              data?.product
            }</span> to you. Therefore, you have
            committed the offence of cheating, criminal breach of trust and
            criminal misappropriation by not making the payment of Loan
            Installments, therefore caused wrongful loss to my client and wrongful
            gain yourself, whereas you are liable for the punishment up to 7 years
            for committing the aforesaid criminal offences besides the civil
            liability to pay the outstanding loan amount.
            <br />
  
            Therefore, I on behalf of my client hereby call upon you to pay the
            amount of <span class="bold">Rs.${data?.noticeBalance}/-</span> to
            my client within 7 days from the date of receipt of this notice
            failing which my client would be constrained to take following
