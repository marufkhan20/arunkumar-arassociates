            intention, you have applied for issuance of Credit Card and also
            assured that you will make the timely payments, whereas on the basis
            of your assurances and promises, my client got convinced and induced
            to issue the credit card and now you have committed default in making
            the due payments of credit card, thus my client suffered the losses
            due to your guilty intention and by the act to breach the trust,
            however if my client was aware about your guilty intention earlier
            definitely they would not have issued the Credit card to you,
            therefore you have committed the offence of cheating, criminal breach
            of trust and criminal misappropriation by not making the due payment
            of Credit Card, therefore caused wrongful loss to my client and
            wrongful gain yourself, whereas you are liable for the punishment upto
            7 years for committing the aforesaid criminal offences besides the
